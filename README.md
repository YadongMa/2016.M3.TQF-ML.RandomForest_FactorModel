# RandomForest_FactorModel
- This project aims to use some machine learning methods to find out the predicting ability of some factors.
- In this project, we choose 8 useful factors in Chinese stock markets. And then we use several efficient machine learning methods to predict the probablity of falling into the GOOD group as the scores of stocks. Then we make decision based on the scores we get.
- The result shows some method do gives excelent performance such as Logistic regression and RandomForest Classifier.
